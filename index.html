          <h2>Personal Summary</h2>
          <p>
            I'm a young motivated individual with a strong technical background.
            I love working in teams, breaking down problems and lateral
            thinking. Outside of the workplace you'll find me practising karate,
            lifting weights, solving Rubik's cubes, coding daily and
            volunteering my time to help others.

                  Leslie has been through a very intensive and challenging
                  bootcamp. He has completed between 800 and 1,000 hours coding
                  on multiple projects in a team environment. We found Leslie to
                  be a collaborative member of his cohort. He achieved a high
                  standard and we wish him all the best in the next steps in his
                  career.

            <h3>Currently focusing on</h3>
            <p>
              Every day I continue to expand my programming knowledge and I'm
              always actively looking for projects to collaborate on. I
              volunteer as a tutor for current students at Enspiral Dev Academy.
              At the gym, I'm training towards my second half marathon and
              starting the day energized. In the workplace, you'll find me
              learning all I can about Site Realibility, organisational SLO and
              SLA goals and studying AWS.
